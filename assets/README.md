# Card Tag Web – Assets

Inventory of assets for the landing site, sourced from the Stickers Newry / Card Tag iOS app.

---

## Available

| File | Source | Size | Use |
|------|--------|------|-----|
| **app-icon.png** | `Stickers Newry/.../Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png` | 1024×1024 | Logo, favicon, hero, watermark reference |
| **launch-icon.png** | `Stickers Newry/.../Assets.xcassets/LaunchIcon.imageset/LaunchIcon.png` | 1024×1024 | Same as app icon; alternate if needed |

Both icons match the spec: dark grey rounded tag shape with off-white label.

---

## Screenshots

Add your app screenshots here:

```
assets/screenshots/
```

**Recommended filenames** (the site will use these automatically):
- `hero.png` – Main hero image
- `gallery-1.png`, `gallery-2.png`, `gallery-3.png` – Gallery images

If these files don't exist, the app icon is shown as a fallback.

---

## Still Needed (optional)

- **Export mockups** – e.g. 3×3 Pokémon card mockup with price labels, condition badges, quantity badges. Save exports from the app to Photos, then add to `assets/` or `assets/screenshots/`.
